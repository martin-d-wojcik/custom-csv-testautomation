# My Automated Csv Framework 
Basic infrastructure of custom-made automated tests that verifes csv files. 
My goal is to write my own functions for assertions of expected results instead of using external libraries. 



## Read a csv file
Use the built-in csv library to read a comma-separeted .txt file into a dictionary.


## Organization.txt 
This is a comma-seperated file containing the columns below:
* Index
* Organization Id 
* Name
* Website 
* Country 
* Description
* Founded 
* Industry
* Number of employees


## TODOs
Unit tests of framework functions
